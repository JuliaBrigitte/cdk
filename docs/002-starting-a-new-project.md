# Starting a new CDK project

The [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-typescript.html) provides a command to generate a starter project. From there, you can install this library and get started defining your new stack.

The [Guardian CDK CLI](https://github.com/guardian/cdk-cli) also provides some tooling, currently focused on migration but eventually for setting up new stacks too.
