# Custom ESLint Rules

This directory defines any custom rules to be checked against the @guardian/cdk library.

These rules should all have a corresponding [ADR](../docs/architecture-design-records).

More information on building custom rules can be found on the [eslint site](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules).
